# "The World's Most Annoying Cookie Consent Form" 🍪🍪🍪🍪


This is a very small side-project in recapping some JavaScript DOM manipulation, through Scrimba's "Essential JavaScript Concepts" course.


Skills in practice:

- element.style
- forms
- formData & .get()
- event.preventDefault()
- toggling classes
- 'disabled' attribute
